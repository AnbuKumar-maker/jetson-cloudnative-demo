Cloud native is a term used to describe container-based environments. Cloud-native technologies are used to develop applications built with services packaged in containers, deployed as microservices and managed on elastic infrastructure through agile DevOps processes and continuous delivery workflows.  Containers offer both efficiency and speed compared with standard virtual machines. Jetson supports cloud native development through the use of Docker containers and pre-trained deep learning models that we have available on NVIDIA GPU Cloud.
